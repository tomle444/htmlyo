<p>Jekyll is a nice little static site generator that is great for a number of purposes. If you are a Front End Developer who doesn't like dealing with a complicated backend system or if you are looking to create a small and compact website in a short amount of time, Jekyll might be a great solution for you.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong><br />
	<ol>
		<li>Jekyll is pretty fast. If you are a developer who works in a local environment and likes to see instant results when making changes, Jekyll will be great for you. Everything on Jekyll is compiled client side, no server side code to render things out. The native SASS/SCSS code generation is almost instantaneous and Ruby compiles the Jekyll code just as fast. It has great potential for getting fairly good SEO rankings as every page is it's own static HTML page.</li>
		<li>Jekyll is super secure. No backend database is required so you don't need to worry about securing a database with lots of sensitive information.</li>
		<li>Jekyll is native to GitHub. GitHub provides a service that allows you to host the entire Jekyll website on GitHub.com. You can buy a domain name and add a CNAME record to the repository and you have a legit, running website.</li>
		<li>Jekyll is dynamic code which can save you a lot of time. Creating a static site by hand can be a tedious task although there are many tools and templates out there that helps out with this. But with Jekyll you can still make dynamic code very similar to Javascript or PHP that will save you a lot of time and a lot of code writing.</li>
		<li>The learning curve isn't too steep. If you already have experience writing Javascript or PHP code, Jekyll will be a piece of cake. There is a lot of documentation available online and the Jekyll community is very helpful.</li>
		<li>Jekyll templates and themes are available. Don't like the default theme? Checkout places like <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/" target="_blank">Jekyll Themes</a> or <a href="http://jekyllthemes.io/" target="_blank">Jekyll Themes.io</a> for a wide variety of free and premium Jekyll themes.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong><br />
	<ol>
		<li>Jekyll is NOT a CMS. So if you have a client that wants to do things themselves but has very little knowledge of HTML, I would steer away from using Jekyll. Jekyll should be updated by a designer/developer if changes need to be made so Jekyll may not be the best solution for those HTML DIY'ers.</li>

		<li>Your Jekyll site may end up having a lot of files to maintain. Even though it is a dynamic system, depending on the complexity of the site you may end up having a lot of files and directories to maintain. It is best to think ahead and plan your site out accordingly to be sure Jekyll is being used in the most efficient manner.</li>
	</ol>
